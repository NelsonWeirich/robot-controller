# robot-controller

Simulated client-server system for robot controller. The system is divided into two
parts: a client and a server. The client sends some commands to the server to
control the mechanic of the robot.

This is the final project
of the Real-Time Operating Systems discipline
of the Computer Engineering course
at the Federal University of Santa Maria
in the semester 2018/1.

## Instalation

Clone the repository and enter into the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NelsonWeirich/robot-controller.git
cd robot-controller
```

Enter into the "cliente" directory and compile the source code with `make`:

```sh
cd cliente
```

Enter into the "servidor" directory and compile the source code with `make`:

```sh
cd ../servidor
make
```

## Usage

Open two terminal windows. Enter into the `robot-controller` directory in the
both terminal.

In one, enter into the "servidor" directory and run it with port number
(>= 1024). The server will run in the localhost:

```sh
cd servidor
./servidor 8080
```

In the another one, enter into the "cliente" directory and run it with the
hostname and port number:

```sh
cd cliente
./cliente localhost 8080
```

In the client terminal, you cand send the following commands:

* `right [NN]`
* `left [NN]`
* `forward [NN]`
* `back [NN]`
* `stop`
* `exit`

Where `NN` indicates the number of units to move.
