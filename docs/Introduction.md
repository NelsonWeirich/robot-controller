A robot can perform many tasks according to the environment in which it is inserted. In addition,
it is necessary to have stability control when it is stopped or even in movement. 
It can also be controlled remotely or be fully autonomous in its
tasks. Robots for manipulating surgeries or for welding industrial parts are some of the
examples of remotely controlled robot.

To achieve the objective of this work, a client-server communication system will be developed
for simulation of a controlled Cartesian coordinate manipulator robot
remotely. This will be a simulated system, i.e., the final tasks will not be performed
for triggering any mechanism, it will only be a representation of the functioning of
a real system.

The user will be able to interact with the machine using keywords to define
the task to perform. By sending commands through a communication interface, the user
controls the machine's actions and receives responses from the system's state sensors.
Therefore, tasks to control communication and tasks to control the measurement system 
will be necessary.
